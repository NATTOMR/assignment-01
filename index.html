        <h1>Why Web Development??</h1>
          <p>Front-end development consists of the user interface (UI) and the 
            look and feel of the website or application. 
            Back-end development consists of the databases, logic, APIs, servers and everything 
            else that powers the website behind the scenes.</p>

            <h2>I will Do Coding and Change The World</h2>
            <p>Front-end development is responsible for the aspects of a 
              website that users see and interact with: the user interface (UI).
               Front-end developers are well-versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
               often working closely with design and UX teams to capture both the intended
                look and feel of the site, while also creating a
               quality user experience across multiple device types.</p>
